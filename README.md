# the-game-of-chess

This is our final project submission for SE181 - Introduction to Software Engineering and Development. Before building this project, we created a Software Requirements Specification Document, Software Design Document, and Test Cases Document. 

The Game of Chess is a simple browser-based chess game in which 2 players can connect and play chess together. This project uses Vue.js, Vue-router, and Vuetify for the frontend and a Node.js server with socket.io for the backend. In order to play chess, first serve the backend and then serve the frontend. 

## backend setup

npm install
```

### Compiles and runs server
